This is a project where I have built a hashtable(dictionary) from scratch in order to better understand how dictionaries work. I used Test driven development in every step of the code.

My starting goal was to understand how searching an item in a dictionary is faster than an array.

Things I have learned while making this project: 
  What a hash funciton is and the properties of a good hash function
  How hash collisions are handled
  Test Driven Development
